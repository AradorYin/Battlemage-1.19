    Elements:
    1. The elements have different effects on the mortal planes of existence.
    2. Some entities roaming about appear to have some kind of resistance to some elements.
    3. Some elements seem to have status debuffs or buffs. I wonder if I can stack these to multiply the damage done
        to mine enemies?
    4. I might be able to make more Elemental Sigils using a magical apparatus. I wonder what other uses these Elemental
        Sigils have.
    5.
