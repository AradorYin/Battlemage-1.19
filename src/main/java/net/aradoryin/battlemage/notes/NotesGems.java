    Gems:
    1. The gems can be engraved with the sigil of an element to focus the elemental powers through.
    2. The gems have an inherent ability with certain elements. Maybe I can use this as an early means of choosing my
        elements?
    3. The gems alter some aspects of the elemental powers passing through them. Maybe I can discover what aspects
        they alter and use that to my advantage?
    4. Maybe I can alter the Elemental Obelisks with certain types of gems to influence magical crafting?
    5. I seem to be able to purchase some gems from some local tradesmen. I wonder if they will have better
        quality gems for sale.
