    Spells:
    1. There seem to be 3 different spell choices. Maybe if I build a magical apparatus if that would help me build
        what spells I want?
    2. The spells choices that I seem to be limited to have different functions. One attacks a single target; another
        seems to attack an area using some kind of explosion; and the last one seems to create a magical forcefield
        in front of me as a means of protection.
    3. I have noticed that the basic spell using single target functionality appears to rotate between different
        options. I have noticed the regular single target spell, a beam of elemental energy, and a grenade of
        elemental energy.
    4. I have also noticed that my area of effect spells also cycle through some different spell options. Those options
        seem to be the normal area of effect explosion that may break some blocks around it, a pool of elemental energy
        that appears to be some kind of damage over time effect, and a rune. The rune does not appear to be affected
        by me, but maybe it is some kind of trap rune for my enemies to stumble into? I wonder what effect each
        element has.
    5. There is a unique interaction with the basic shield spell. I have noted this interaction being like a nova of
        elemental energy that emanates outwards from in front of my person. Each element seems to have a different
        nova when I manage to perfectly time a block.
    6. I don't seem to run when I am carrying the bracer. I seem to teleport a short distance in the direction that
        I originally planned to run in instead. I have also concluded that my shield seems to somehow affect this
        "dash".
