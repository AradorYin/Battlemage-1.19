    Structures:
    1. Elemental Obelisks: structures of an unknown and unique origin. Randomly found obelisks can only be used once
        before becoming dormant. These structures might have grown into their shape long ago and since had their innate
        magical potential sapped from them. No one knows or will ever know more about these structures. I could build
        them and influence my magical crafting with a specific element. Maybe I would have a chance at getting a
        Pristine or Legendary quality of the items being crafted? I wonder what would happen if I inserted a gem
        into the obelisks. For me to build one, I first need to craft Magic-Infused Stone to be used as a cage-like
        structure. The core needs to be an Elemental Core, which can only be made using an Elemental Sigil. I wonder
        how I am going to get the Elemental Blocks needed to surround the core. Maybe I "magic" the Magic-Infused
        Stone?

    2. There is a magical apparatus that I might be able to create. It seems that this is a multilayered device with
        each level performing different crafting. The first level seems to be useful for creating these Elemental
        Sigils. The second layer seems to be some kind of gem station. It seems to be able to chip away at the gem
        placed in it and that it is also able to engrave these Elemental Sigils.  This third later seems the most
        interesting out of all three. There seems to be some kind of physicality to it instead of this
        corporeal-ethereal shenanigans. Maybe there is something that needs to be placed on here? There is a curve-like
        shape hiding in the center - underneath - this peculiar layer. Maybe I need to place the Elemental Sigil
        there to engrave the gem? Or maybe if I leave it empty that it'll be some way that I can add spells to the gem?
        It seems likely that if I form the specified structure below that this device becomes apparent. But how do I
        get some of these ingredients? Maybe I magic them by hitting the Magic-Infused Stone with different elements?

    3.
     You can also be rewarded for finding scrolls, checking out those weird-looking rifts (the long purple and
     black things, that cause you to see purple holograms and wonder "is this real life?")
